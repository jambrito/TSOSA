# TSOSA - Tabu Search Optimal Stratification and Allocation Algorithm
This package provides, through the tsosa function,    an algorithm that stratifies a population defined by    a vector X - with N observations -, aiming to minimize the variance of    the estimator of the total of X. The algorithm combines tabu search metaheuristic with   an exact method for sample allocation.
